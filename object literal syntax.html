				<li>A Javascript object can also be created and defined with an object literal.</li>
				<br>
				<li>An Object literal is just curly braces, and we can put a semicolon at the end because it is a statement.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Spaces and line breaks are not important. An Object literal can span multiple lines.</li>
				<br>
				<li>The Object literal syntax is much prefered to the new object syntax because it is much more readable and much faster to type.</li>
