	<h3>Function Constructors, Prototype, and the 'this' keyword.</h3>
	<p>With Function constructors, you can create an object using the keyword 'new'. </p>
	<h4>What happens when you invoke a function?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>A New Execution context is created within which whatever is inside the function is actually executed.</li>
		<li>When you invoke a function together with the 'New' keyword, the Js engine makes "this" point to the object itself that got created.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>    "This"  </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>In Javascript, the "this" keyword refers to an object.</li>
		<li>It points to the global window object. That is, the object that has all the parameters and properties in Javascript.</li>
	</ul>
