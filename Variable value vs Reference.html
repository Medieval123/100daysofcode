	<h1>Variables by values vs Reference.</h1>
	<h3>Passing by Value</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Given b=a, passing/copying by value means changing copied value in b does not affect the value stored in a and vice versa.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Passing by Reference.</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Given b=a, passing/copying by Reference means changing copied value in b does indeed affect the value stored in a and vice versa.</li>
	</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>In Javascript, Primitives are passed by value, while Objects are passed by Reference.</li>
				<li>"Under the hood", everything is actually passed by value.</li>
				<li>The difference comes because of the way the Objects and Primitives are stored in memory.</li>
			</ul>
	<h2>The difference bettween Passed by value and References.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>In Passed by value, the values, once it is changed do not affect the Original value of the Original variable.</li>
				<li>As Opposed to Passed by Reference, when yoy change the value, the Original object that it is pointing to changes as well.</li>
			</ul>
