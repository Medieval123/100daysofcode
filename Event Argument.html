	<p>The 'event' argument is an argument that is passed by the Javascript Engine into every single event handler.</p>
	<p>The Mozilla Development Network talks about all kinds of events that can happen and obviously, depending on what type of event that happens, either a key press, or a mouse press/mousemove which is in interaction with the mouse.</p>
	<p>There are different types of objects that can contain different types of properties related to an event type. Some of them are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>KeyboardEvent object: This is related to keyboard events.</li>
		<li>mouseEvent object: gives you a bunch of different properties of the mouse event passed like the clientX and clientY.</li>
		<li>clientX is the X coordinate of the mouse pointer in the local DOM content coordinates. Types of mouse events include:</li><br>
		<ul>
		<li>mouse out.</li>
		<li>mouse over.</li>
		<li>mouse move.</li>
	</ul>
