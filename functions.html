			<ul>
				<li>A Javascript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by the name, and then Parentheses ().</li>
				<li>Functions in Javascript are first class data types; meaning that whatever you could do to a variable or an object, you could also do to a function.</li>
				<li>Functions in Js are also objects.</li>
				<li>Every object has this inherent method or function called "to strings".</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A Function is much the same as a Procedure or a Subroutine, in other Proramming Languages.</p>
