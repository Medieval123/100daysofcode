	<h1> Javascript CLOSURES.</h1>
	<p>In Javascript, a closure is a function that references variables in the outer scope from its inner scope. The closure preserves the outer scope inside its inner scope.</p>
	<h3>Lexical Scoping.</h3>
	<p>Lexical scoping defines the scope of a variable by the position of that variable declared in the source code.The scopes can be nested and the inner function can access the variables declared in its outer scope.</p>
	<p>When a variable  is referenced inside of a function, the first thing it does is check whether or not this variable has been defined inside of its local lexical Enviromment.</p>
